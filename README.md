# Build Real time Google Play store data analytics - python


# Internship Report

## Introduction

During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on **Google Play Store Data Analytics**, where I analyzed app performance metrics, user engagement, and trends. The experience allowed me to apply my data analysis skills in a real-world setting, strengthening both my technical and problem-solving abilities.

## Background

This internship was part of my **training program**, and my goal was to implement what I learned in a hands-on project. The task involved cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing Play Store data to extract meaningful insights. Additionally, I had to ensure my work was structured well enough for submission through GitHub.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain experience in handling real-world datasets
- Enhance my skills in **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and other data analysis tools
- Improve my ability to **filter, transform, and visualize** large datasets
- Learn how to work independently and **troubleshoot issues without mentor support**
- Strengthen my GitHub workflow by organizing and submitting my work properly

## Activities and Tasks

### Key Tasks:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
   - Dealt with missing values, formatted data types, and filtered necessary information
   - Transformed ‘Installs’ and ‘Reviews’ columns to numeric formats for analysis

2. **Data Analysis & Visualization:**
   - Explored category-wise installs, ratings, and user engagement
   - Created **bar charts, violin plots, line charts, and heatmaps** to visualize insights
   - Applied **conditional filtering** to ensure graphs only appeared at specific times

3. **Challenges & Debugging:**
   - Faced issues with data type conversions and filtering criteria
   - Researched and fixed errors related to **string operations, datetime comparisons, and Seaborn plotting**

4. **Final Submission & Documentation:**
   - Organized my work into a structured **Jupyter Notebook**
   - Pushed my project to **GitHub** following best practices
   - Ensured all internship requirements were met

## Skills and Competencies Gained

- **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning, formatting, and preparing data for analysis
- **Data Visualization:** Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to present insights effectively
- **Logical Thinking & Debugging:** Solving technical issues independently
- **Time Management:** Sticking to deadlines without external guidance
- **GitHub Workflow:** Managing repositories and project submissions professionally

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Issue:** Errors due to non-numeric values in ‘Installs’ and ‘Reviews’
  - **Solution:** Used `.str.replace()` and `.astype()` to convert them to proper formats

- **Issue:** Graphs were appearing at all times instead of specified time slots
  - **Solution:** Implemented **datetime filtering** to restrict visibility within given timeframes

- **Issue:** Correlation heatmap wasn’t working due to incompatible data types
  - **Solution:** Converted necessary columns and restructured the dataset properly
 
## **Feedback:**

During the internship, there were a few instances where I encountered difficulties, especially with data conversions and time-based filtering, but I was able to work through these challenges. While some tasks were hard, they pushed me to think critically and develop problem-solving skills. The level of the questions and tasks was appropriate, which allowed me to learn and grow as a data analyst.

## **Evidence:**

I successfully resolved issues with non-numeric values in the dataset by using data conversion methods and filtering techniques. The final project, including cleaned data and visualizations, was pushed to GitHub, showcasing my ability to handle the challenges independently. All tasks were completed according to the requirements, and the solution was well-documented in the Jupyter notebook.

## Outcomes and Impact

Completing this internship gave me hands-on experience in data analytics, helping me understand how to extract meaningful insights from large datasets. It also improved my ability to work independently, troubleshoot issues, and communicate findings effectively through visualizations.

Additionally, I gained confidence in handling real-world datasets, which will be valuable for future projects and career opportunities in data analysis.

## Conclusion

This internship was a great learning experience, pushing me to think critically and solve problems on my own. I now feel more confident in **data handling, visualization, and project documentation**. Moving forward, I aim to apply these skills to more complex datasets and continue improving my analytical abilities.

I’m really grateful for this experience and excited to take on more challenges in the field of data analytics!
